> This project involved creating a pixel-perfect website from a design, including several interactive features such as parralax effects and carousels. I was able to complete 4 sections of the website in 3 days and found the project to be interesting and challenging. The only difficulty was making the website mobile-friendly without a mobile design, but I was able to be creative and find solutions. Overall, I am pleased with the outcome of the project and wish I had more time to complete the other sections.

> Tech stack used:
-React 18.2.0
-TailwindCSS 3.2.7
